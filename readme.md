evolve-D
======================

Evolve-D(earborn) encapsulates simplicity, function, and style as it unites many notable Moodle theme features into an evolved "More" theme. Evolve-D applies famed theme elements such as a custom front page, Google Fonts, My Courses drop down, block icons, a front page image display and a variety of other enhancements made popular in Essential, Aardvark, and other Moodle Themes.  The evolve-D theme's appeal comes from it's simple 2 column design, muted colors, and focus on displaying learning content and minimizing distractions for students and teachers.

[Dearborn Public Schools](http://dearbornschools.org) is a K-12 school district in Dearborn, Michigan. We designed and use evolve-D on our Moodle site.

Special thanks to [Aardvark](https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=theme_aardvark) and [Essential](https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=theme_essential) theme developers Shaun Daubney and Julian Ridden for thier work which is replicated in part here.

Special care has been taken to make this theme for the teachers of Dearborn Public Schools.  We support and love Moodle.

evolved-D 2.1.1 Release Notes:
- If Moodle Security is set to force users to login(different from just activating the custom login page) the General and Snow alerts will not display.  Fixed issue on this Moodle security forced login page which caused the login to disappear. 
- Fixed css issue on message page on mobile devices.  Messages should now display properly when viewing on a mobile device.

evolved-D 2.0.5 Release Notes:
- Fixed background color issue for current topic/week not changing color.
- Added ability to customize Socialwall timeline labels.  These labels identify different areas of the post structure such as the Post, the Message contained in the post, Comments, and Attachments.  With custom labels you can change the text and icon to localize it.


evolved-D 2.0.4 Release Notes:
- Video Demonstration https://youtu.be/XSgFnYXgz_E
- Added Language strings to custom login page.
- Added a fix for some special Socialwall Course Format styling in which we used CSS :before selectors to inject text such as Attachments, Comments, Message, and Post.  This led to problems with other languages.  We added the top 4 languages and instructions on how to change this if you use Evolve-D with Socialwall Course format.  This is not an issue unless you have the Socialwall Course Format installed.
- Added new CSS styling to course sections and weeks so that each section is clearly seperated providing visual cues to the learner of section/weekly breaks. 
- Added new theme admin page Socialwall Course Format Options.  Will allow Moodle Admin to pick colors for the socialwall course format timeline.  Must be using the Socialwall Course Format  https://moodle.org/plugins/browse.php?list=set&id=74
- Special thanks to Mary Evans and germanvaleroelizondo for helping identify and fix some of the language issues to be more universal.

- Many css issues were fixed. Mainly the editbuttons, forum search field, and Annotate PDF lightbox.
