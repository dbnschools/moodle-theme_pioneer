# Moodle-theme_pioneer
Pioneer is a beautiful, responsive theme loaded with great features from custom tabs and a course gradebook slider to the ability for teachers to upload their own header image in course summary files! Each of the main elements in the theme can be customized from the theme settings page.  Pioneer is Made in Michigan at Dearborn Public Schools.

##Pioneer v1.3.9
* Improved layout
* Main Content Icon Navigation now shows text for link. Previously it was displayed as a tooltip.
* Homepage slideshow of featured courses now has a button which will show a listing of all featured courses at a glance.
* Bottom Featured course slider shows 4 items by default (up to 12 total) and is responsive so that as your screen size gets smaller less items will show in view.  On a cellphone only one item is displayed.
* Changed Block Styling based on feedback.  Block headings are now colorful and based on the previous icon box color.  However, in theme settings you can pick a single color for all block heading titles.


##Pioneer v1.3.8
* Fixed menu bar on login page /moodle/login/index.php.

* Too many CSS improvements to count.
* Utilizing the header images of courses throughout the site in various capacities

##Pioneer v1.3.7
* Added ability to control the frontpage background image size by adjusting padding from the theme settings page.  Padding is applied above and below the login form.

##Pioneer v1.3.6
* Fixed issue with Socialwall Course Format in which save buttons were hidden from view.

##Pioneer v1.3.5
* Fixed a slight issue with Google Analytics and defined variables.
* Moved the background image upload and parameters from General Settings to the page with the color pickers since it is part of the background colors.
* Added a box styling to all main content including in-course activity pages.  This should have been done before releasing.  From the homepage to the course page everything was inside a styled box... until you went to an activity and then the box went away.  There is now a color picker for the box that wraps activities.
* Numerous CSS fixes and enhancements. 

##Pioneer v1.3.4
* Google Analytics added to theme.  Now site admins can simply add the UA tracking id number and begin collecting traffic and usage of their moodle site with clean URL's.  

##Pioneer v1.3.3
* The Course Grade Slider can now be controlled by the teacher.  If course settings is set to Not Show Gradebook to Students then the Course Grade slider will not display.  In order to use the Course Grade Slider it must be turned on in Admin Theme Settings for Pioneer and at the course level to show gradebook to students which is set by the teacher on a course by course setting.

##Pioneer v1.3.2
* New feature - Position blocks to the right or left of the content.  We added a position toggle on the general settings page to pick where the blocks appear.  This has been a much requested feature as some people like the blocks on the left.  

##Pioneer v1.3.1
* Continued refining of Pioneer theme setting pages.
* Added more control over icon navigation and course search box.  A toggle to Show Top, Show Main Content, Both and Never.  This is useful if you need to free up space in the top navigation bar and want to remove the icons and searchbox.
* When the custom frontpage textbox is present the icon nav and searchbox appear within the textbox for a clean look.  However, if the frontpage textbox is not present the icon nav and searchbox can still appear standalone in the maincontent area based on the display toggle.  
* Checkbox for display search box in top nav.  Checkbox for display search box in main content.  

##Pioneer v1.3.0
* Tab/Course Grade Toggle button and buttonhover colors can now be set in theme settings.
* Fixed settings.php error which caused double general settings link to appear twice.

##Pioneer v1.2.9
* Added custom color for breadcrumb bar which appears below the header image.
* Added Copyright Notice in footer area.
* CSS fixes and enhancements
* Updated language strings and settings pages to be more intuitive. 
* My Classes and This Course drop down menus will now include a scroll bar if the list of items is too long. 
* Removed My Grades from This Course dropdown menu.  Causes issues if show gradebook to students is turned off.  
* Added Tools custom drop down menu for quick links as a custom menu option.
* Duplicate Language drop down Menu is fixed.
* Topnav Drop Down menus will only support single column menus. This is to accomodate very long My Classes and This Course Menus.  If anyone can help with a CSS fix I would appreciate this.  I do believe it can be fixed with some simple CSS adjustments but I am at a loss and we don't use more than a single column links.

##Pioneer v1.2.8
* Added a theme admin page to create a custom footer with the ability to use a single full-width textbox or a 4 column layout with 4 individual textboxes. Or choose to use both!
* If no site logo is uploaded the topnav bar will now default to the site title and link to the frontpage.
* Revisited and fixed an issue with the large frontpage icons and searchbox display toggle not truly hiding when it was supposed to be hidden.
* Marketing Spots will only appear on homepage/frontpage.  They will no longer display past the homepage.  This makes the courses nicer and less cluttered.
* Centered featured courses when less than 6 are used.
* Added This Course dropdown menu for quick access to course activities.
* My Classes now reflects the ordering and settings of the Course Overview Block on the Dashboard.

##Pioneer v1.2.6 & 1.2.7
* Moved User Menu up to top navigation bar next to my courses dropdown.
* Moved top icon nav next to course search box on right side of screen.
* Added toggle to show or hide the larger iconnav and course searchbox from being displayed with the Frontpage Textbox. This is useful for first time users but the same icons and search is available in the top navigation menu.  This simply makes it more obvious to the user and in the textbox you can explain what/how you want the user to do in the site.  
* Fixed secure site layout file to be in line with theme.

##Pioneer v1.2.5
* Added frontpage enhancement. If you utilize the frontpage textbox you will now see the same icons with tooltips located in the top navigation but they will be quit larger and it also includes the course search bar.  We discovered that most people prefer the larger icon navigation on the homepage with the custom text box.  This allows the site admin to provide instructions and key navigational links as the first thing someone sees upon logging in.  
* When a new header image is uploaded in theme settings it will also be used for courses with no-image when Featured or displayed as Available Courses on the frontpage. This fixes the issue of having to FTP a no-image.jpg up to the server in the theme pix folder.  This was first introduced in version 1.2.3 and a bug was found.  This has been fixed and reinstated.  

##Pioneer v1.2.4
* Removed frontpage featured courses from using an uploaded header image. Found a bug which displays no image if the course doesn't have an image and there is no header image uploaded in settings.  It should default to an image in the pix folder but it does not.  I need more time with the code to make it work.
* Added custom colog for the frontpage login button.  

##Pioneer v1.2.3
* When a new header image is uploaded in theme settings it will also be used for courses with no-image when Featured or displayed as Available Courses on the frontpage. This fixes the issue of having to FTP a no-image.jpg up to the server in the theme pix folder. 
* Course title no longer appears as a black bar across the whole top of the page.  It is centered and paddded to only fill the space of the text. This allows the header image to be more visible without a distracting black bar across the full width. 
* Marketing Box buttons now appear right aligned. Somehow this got changed in 1.2.2 but is now corrected.
* Some css cleanup for Mybadges page to hide the fptextbox and tabbutton/tabs due to mybadges using Mydashboard layout.

##Pioneer v1.2.2
* Fixed IPad buttons not working for frontpage tabs and view course grades.
* Fixed marketing spots full width when not enough text to fill space.
* Custom Text for Course Grades Button.

* Fixed Language string
* Increased max width of button text for frontpage tabs and course grades to 500px.
* Numerous css fixes.

##Pioneer v1.2.1
* Six custom frontpage tabs which are displayed via a slider button.  Add a title and content text for each tab.  Tabs fade in and out with content.
* Found bug for SSL and login with featured courses enabled.  Fix is to force users to login before seeing featured courses.
* When using the default Moodle login page featured courses is not displayed.  This is to fix a bug with featured courses.  If your site uses SSL for login only, please click in Site Admin to Force Login.
* Seeking input for best way to fix the SSL and featured courses bug. Alternative is to make featured courses only visible when logged in.


##Pioneer v1.2.0

* Chnaged styling of Marketing spots to be a little less "shocking" as one teacher put it.

* At the request of our teachers we switched back to a horizontal alignment for the side block titles.  However, we kept the border width on the left of the blocks to create a visual separation.
* Each block has a fontawesome icon and color background next to the title.  
* Social icons bar at bottom is now full width.  This replaces just showing them in the bottom right.  It will also allow for future items to be placed in this bar.
